# Nexa_RoomComplexityModel
## Room Complexity Measurement
This project aims to measure the complexity of a room using three methods: area-based complexity, entropy-based complexity, and visual clutter. These scores are combined using a fuzzy logic approach to determine the overall complexity score and level.

#### Features
- Area-Based Complexity: Measures the ratio of object area to the total room area.
- Entropy-Based Complexity: Calculates the entropy of marked objects to measure randomness and disorder.
- Visual Clutter: Assesses the overlap and density of objects in the room.
- Fuzzy Logic Integration: Combines the three complexity scores to produce an overall complexity score and level.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pillow
- SciPy
- scikit-fuzzy

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Run the following command in your terminal:
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/thilinapremachandra/Nexa_Color_Match.git
     ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory:**
   - Change to the `Research-RoomComplexityModel` directory:
     ```sh
     cd Nexa_Color_Match/Research-RoomComplexityModel
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Install the required Python packages:
     ```sh
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

```sh
jupyter notebook
```
Open and execute the RoomComplexityModel.ipynb notebook.

### Usage

#### Mark Objects in the Image
Load an image:
```sh
image_path = "path_to_your_image.jpg"
```

The user will be prompted to mark objects in the image by clicking on the vertices of a polygon around each object. Right-click to close the polygon, press 'Enter' to finish marking an object, and 'Esc' to finish marking all objects.

#### Calculate Complexity Scores
The program calculates three complexity scores:

Area-Based Complexity Score: Calculates the ratio of the object area to the total room area.

Entropy-Based Complexity Score: Computes the entropy of marked objects to measure randomness and disorder.

Visual Clutter Score: Measures the overlap and density of objects in the room.

### Fuzzy Logic Integration
The three complexity scores are combined using a fuzzy logic approach to produce an overall complexity score and level (Low or High).

### Example Output

Area-Based Complexity Score: 0.45

Entropy-Based Complexity Score: 0.35

Clutter Score: 0.25

Final Complexity Score: 0.58, Complexity Level: High

# Real-Time Visualization Project

Welcome to the **Real-Time Visualization** project! This project demonstrates real-time data visualization using Java and the OpenCV library. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:
* **Android Studio** installed on your system
* **Java Development Kit (JDK)**
* **OpenCV Library** version 4.10.0

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thilinapremachandra/Nexa_Color_Match
cd Research4-RealTimeVisualizationMode
```

### 2. Add OpenCV Library to the Project

1. Download OpenCV Library version 4.10.0 from the official OpenCV website
2. Import the OpenCV library as a module in your Android Studio project:
   * Open Android Studio
   * Go to File > New > Import Module
   * Browse to the folder where you downloaded the OpenCV library
   * Select the library folder and follow the prompts to complete the import process

### 3. Modify the build.gradle File

To avoid errors during the build process:

1. Open the build.gradle file for the OpenCV module
2. Locate the following line:
   ```gradle
   apply plugin: 'kotlin-android'
   ```
3. This step ensures compatibility with the Java-based project

### 4. Run the Project

Once the setup is complete:

1. Clean and rebuild the project:
   * Go to Build > Clean Project
   * Then go to Build > Rebuild Project
2. Connect an emulator or a physical Android device
3. Run the project to see the real-time visualization in action
